    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons curry powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch saltr</li>
        <li>¼ cup margarine</li>
        <li>¼ cup shortening</li>
        <li>⅓ cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Prepare pastry: Combine flour, curry powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut in margarine and shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water until mixture forms a ball. Shape dough into a log and cut it into 10 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 6-inch circle (approximately 1/8-inch thick) on a lightly floured surface; set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare filling: Melt margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion until soft and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in ground beef; season with curry powder, thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until beef is evenly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in beef broth and bread crumbs. Simmer until liquid is absorbed; remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Spoon equal amounts of filling onto each pastry circle. Fold over and press edges together, making a half-circle. Use the back of a fork to seal edges, then brush tops with beaten egg. Place pastries on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.</li>
